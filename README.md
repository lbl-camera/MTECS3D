# Multi-Tiered Estimation for Correlation Spectroscopy in 3D (MTECS3D)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/887082775.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14090991)

_Multi-Tiered Estimation for Correlation Spectroscopy in 3D (MTECS3D)_ is an algorithm designed for estimating the rotational diffusion coefficient
from the angular-temporal cross-correlation of X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy images.
The algorithm is described detailedly in [our paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214305). 
A relevant presentation can be found [here](https://camera.lbl.gov/seminars) (titled _The Mathematics of Advanced Correlation Data Analysis: How to extract complex dynamics from next-generation correlation spectroscopy experiments_).

## Download

Clone via

```
git clone https://github.com/lbl-camera/MTECS3D.git
```

## Build

To build _MTECS3D_, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

-   A **C++ compiler** supporting the C++17 standard or higher
-   **CMake** (minimum version 3.20)
-   **Eigen3**
-   **GNU Scientific Library (GSL)**
-   **HDF5 C Library**
-   **Intel MKL** (if not available, other implementations of CBLAS and LAPACKE are required)

Then, the project can be built using the following commands:

```shell script
# In the project directory
mkdir build  # It is recommended to create a separate build directory
cd build
cmake .. # If not in the build directory, replace ".." with the path to the CMakeLists.tx
make
```

After a successful build, an executable `bin/mtecs3d` will be created in the `bin` directory.

## Usage

All the arguments required by `bin/mtecs3d`, including parameters and the path to data files, are specified through the "../config.txt" file. An example `example/config.txt` is provided.
Then, _MTECS3D_ works in a two-step manner. Here is an example:

```shell command
# In the build directory
../bin/mtecs3d reduce ../example/config.txt
../bin/mtecs3d extract ../example/config.txt
```

The "reduce" step reduces the full angular-temporal cross-correlation into a compact form, and the "extract" step estimates the desired rotational diffusion coefficient from the reduced data.

The "config.txt" file should contain the following arguments for the "reduce" step:

-   **CorrFile**: The angular-temporal cross-correlation data.
-   **Lmax**: The truncation frequency of the Legendre expansion of the cross-correlation data.
- **FlatEwaldSphere**: "1" means a flat Ewald sphere is assumed, and "0" if otherwise.
-   **Wavelength**: The wavelength of the X-ray in angstroms (Å).
-   **TruncationLimit**: Indices indicating the boundary of the masking for eliminating the peaks of the correlation data at 0 and $\pi$. The part between the specified indices is the component that will be kept and used by the algorithm.
-   **ReducedCorrFile**: The reduced cross-correlation data file, which will be input into the "extract" step.
-   **Verbose**: "1" indicates more verbose output, and "0" otherwise.

For the "extract" step, the following arguments are required:

-   **ReducedCorrFile**: The reduced cross-correlation data file from which the rotational diffusion coefficient will be estimated.
-   **DeltaT**: The time difference between consecutive measurements of images in seconds.
-   **Diameter**: An estimate of the upper bound of the particle structure diameter in angstroms (Å). This estimate should exceed the actual value, e.g., approximately tens of percent larger than the actual diameter is sufficient.
-   **MaxExtractIter**: Maximum iteration of the algorithm.
-   **Tol**: Stopping tolerance of the algorithm.
-   **Verbose**: "1" indicates more verbose output, and "0" otherwise.

Lines in "config.txt" starting with "#" will be omitted.

The 'CorrFile' should be a HDF5 file containing two datasets, "/correlation" and "/q". For example:

```console
foo@bar:~$ h5ls -r example/cross-correlation.hdf5
/                        Group
/correlation             Dataset {16, 81, 81, 1024}
/q                       Dataset {81}
```

-   "Correlation" dataset: Contains the angular-temporal cross-correlation data calculated from the experimental images. Its dimension should be {num of lag times, number of measured q, number of measured q, number of angular coordinates}. Please note that HDF5 stores the data in row-major order.
-   "q" dataset: Specifies the grid of the measured q in inverse of angstroms (Å⁻¹). Its dimension should be {number of measured q}.

<!-- For testing, an example data file `example/cross-correlation.hdf5` is provided. The ground truth of the rotational diffusion coefficient is $0.5$. An estimate with relative errors within a few percent should be given by our algorithm. -->
<!-- TODO upload the cross-correlation.hdf5 -->
Please refer to [our paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214305) for more details on the relevant parameters.

## Using as a library

In addition to the executable `bin/mtecs3d`, you can also use the functions provided by this project directly in your C++ code.
Currently, you need to manage the include path and the link line on your own. 
<!-- In future versions, we will provide the CMAKE config file to enable the MTECS3D package to be easily found by CMAKE. -->

### Including Header Files

In order to do so, the header file should be included as, for example,

```c++
#include "include/mtecs3d.h"
```

### Linking Against the Library

The library can be obtained through the building process described above and linked as

```
lib/libmtecs3d_static.a # or through -lmtecs3d_static
```

In addition to this, you also need to include all the linking lines required by the above dependencies.

### Available Functions and Documentation

By including the header files and linking against the library as described above, you will have access to the following functions:

-   `mtecs3d::ReduceCorrelationData`
-   `mtecs3d::ExtractCoefficient`
-   `mtecs3d::detail::CorNoiseProj`
-   `mtecs3d::detail::BandLimitingProj`
-   `mtecs3d::detail::TensorIsoRotProj`

Documentation about the above functions can be found from where the functions are declared in the source codes.

<!-- Detailed documentation about the above functions and other components of this package can be found in [this documentation page](TODO). -->

<!-- TODO generate the documentation using Doxygen. -->
